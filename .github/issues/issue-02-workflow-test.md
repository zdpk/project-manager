# [FEATURE] Test Claude Action workflow functionality

## Feature Description
Create a test issue to verify that the updated Claude Action workflow is functioning correctly with conditional execution and Rust-specific tools.

## Use Case
- Validate that the new workflow triggers only on @claude mentions
- Confirm Rust tools (cargo build, test, fmt, clippy) are available
- Test issue-to-PR workflow automation
- Ensure proper caching and performance optimizations work

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create a simple test feature request
- [ ] Verify workflow triggers on @claude mention
- [ ] Confirm Rust toolchain installation works
- [ ] Test that cargo commands are available to Claude
- [ ] Validate that dependency caching functions properly
- [ ] Ensure the workflow completes successfully
- [ ] Verify that appropriate responses are generated

## Implementation Notes
- This is a meta-test of the Claude Action system itself
- Should be a simple, low-risk feature to implement
- Can be used to validate the entire CI/CD pipeline

## Related Issues
- Depends on completion of Claude Action workflow updates
- Validates GitHub Actions integration
