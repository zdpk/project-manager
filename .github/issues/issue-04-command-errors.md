# [FEATURE] Integrate error handling across all CLI commands

## Feature Description
Update all CLI commands to use the standardized error types and provide consistent error handling patterns throughout the application.

## Use Case
- Ensure all commands handle errors in a uniform way
- Provide consistent user experience across different operations
- Enable proper error propagation and context preservation
- Simplify debugging and troubleshooting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update `src/commands/init.rs` to use standard error types
- [ ] Update `src/commands/project.rs` to use standard error types  
- [ ] Update `src/commands/config.rs` to use standard error types
- [ ] Update `src/commands/tag.rs` to use standard error types
- [ ] Ensure all commands return Result<(), ProjectError> 
- [ ] Add proper error context for each command operation
- [ ] Update main.rs to handle and display errors consistently
- [ ] Add error recovery suggestions where applicable
- [ ] Ensure error messages include relevant file paths and details

## Implementation Notes
- Build on the error types defined in issue-03-error-types
- Use ? operator for error propagation
- Add context using .with_context() where helpful
- Keep error messages actionable and user-friendly

## Related Issues
- Depends on #03 (error types definition)
