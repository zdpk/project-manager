# [FEATURE] Implement user-friendly error messages with suggestions

## Feature Description
Enhance error messages to be more helpful to end users by providing context, suggestions, and actionable next steps for resolving issues.

## Use Case
- Help users quickly understand what went wrong
- Reduce support requests by providing self-service solutions
- Improve the overall user experience of the CLI tool
- Guide users toward successful task completion

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create error message formatter that includes:
  - [ ] Clear description of what happened
  - [ ] Relevant context (file paths, command arguments)
  - [ ] Suggestions for how to fix the issue
  - [ ] Related commands or documentation links
- [ ] Add colored output for different error severity levels
- [ ] Implement "Did you mean?" suggestions for typos
- [ ] Add help text for common error scenarios:
  - [ ] "Config file not found" → suggest `pm init`
  - [ ] "Not in a git repository" → suggest `git init`
  - [ ] "Project already exists" → suggest using different name
  - [ ] "Permission denied" → suggest checking file permissions
- [ ] Include relevant file paths and line numbers when applicable
- [ ] Provide links to documentation or examples

## Implementation Notes
- Use colored crate for visual distinction of error types
- Consider using similar_asserts or similar libraries for suggestions
- Keep messages concise but informative
- Test error messages with actual users if possible

## Related Issues
- Builds on #03 (error types) and #04 (command errors)
- Improves user experience significantly
